Supply Chain Analytics: Make vs. Buy Decision Support

One of the toughest questions in supply chain is:

Should we manufacture a part ourselves, or buy it from a supplier?

This project uses Power BI to turn that complex decision into a clear, interactive dashboard that supply chain teams and executives can use in real time.

### What I Did

Imported and cleaned supplier quotes, internal cost estimates, and production data.

Built a data model linking suppliers, parts, and cost structures.

Designed interactive scenario sliders so teams can test different production volumes.

Created a Make vs. Buy calculator that compares both options side by side.

Added dynamic cost calculations to reflect extended and full costs (including overhead and capital).

### What I Found

Low volumes → cheaper to buy from suppliers.

High volumes → cheaper to make in-house.

Results change based on cost assumptions, showing the value of scenario testing.

Leaders could now adjust assumptions live in meetings instead of waiting for manual spreadsheet updates.

### Why It Matters for Business

This project shows how data can simplify a million-dollar supply chain decision:

Cut costs → by quickly identifying the most economical option.

Increase agility → leadership can test different “what-if” scenarios in seconds.

Improve decisions → moving beyond static spreadsheets to real-time interactive analysis.

### Bottom Line

The Make vs. Buy Power BI dashboard acts as a decision-support tool for supply chain strategy.
It helps businesses:

Reduce unnecessary spending

Reallocate resources smarter

Speed up strategic decisions

### In short: a process that used to take weeks of analysis can now be answered in minutes.
